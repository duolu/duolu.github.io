Currently I study at Arizona State University (ASU) at Tempe, Arizona. I love building smart IoT systems, smart robots, and smart wearable devices with AI technologies that can sense, make decisions, and act accordingly. I'm good at software development with C/C++, Java, and Python on Linux. Research The main part of my current research is trying to understand in-air-handwriting and use it as an input method , potentially in Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Consider the scenario shown in the following figure, a dialog pops up to an AR/VR user asking a passcode, an ID, or a short piece of text information (e.g., a tweet) as input information. My goal is creating technologies to allow input of information using handwriting in the air captured by cameras or wearable inertial sensors. Currently, my focus is mainly pattern recognition using deep neural network on in-air-handwriting movement data collected by the Leap Motion controller and a custom data glove with an inertial measurement unit. Here is a primitive demo video . This project is sponsored by my advisor Dr. Dijiang Huang.

Smart vehicles are essentially a collection of sensors and computers on wheels. How to build an affordable smart vehicle using commercial off-the-shelf components? How to efficiently construct, deploy, maintain, reuse, and interoperate the software components on them? How to give them intelligent sensing, decision making, and acting behaviors? How to coordinate a fleet of smart vehicles through V2X communication? My goal is studying and trying to answer these questions with practical running robot vehicles made by myself. Here is a primitive demo video of three robot vehicles in a flock (collaborated with Dr. Fengchen Wang and sponsored by Dr. Yan Chen), and here is another primitive demo video of a teleoperate robot vehicle with real-time video streaming using a custom protocol designed by myself (sponsored by Dr. Junshan Zhang).
